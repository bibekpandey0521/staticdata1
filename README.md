🚀 Spring Boot + Thymeleaf Project (Part 1) – Form Handling Done Right! 🧑‍💻

I just completed the first part of a hands-on project using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf, where I:

✅ Created input forms with individual fields and checkboxes
✅ Mapped form data using a POJO model
✅ Returned and displayed a list of users from submitted data
✅ Used Thymeleaf for dynamic form rendering and data display

This was a great exercise to strengthen my understanding of:

Form binding in Spring MVC

Dynamic templates using Thymeleaf

Clean code structure with models and controllers

🔥 Part 2 coming soon with more features (validation, database, etc.)
